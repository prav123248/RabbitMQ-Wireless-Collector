Setup Process
1. Use the spring.start.io website with the config in a screenshot. 
2. Download the latest version of Erlang available at erlang.org/downloads
3. Download RabbitMQ server from the website.

Profiles : 
-Dspring.profiles.active=Receiver
-Dspring.profiles.active=Sender

Adjust between the Sender and Receiver profiles depending on which aspect of the system you need.
Raspberry PI nodes should use Sender. Central point like a laptop should use Receiver.

In Intellij, edit configurations, add VM options and paste the -D text listed above.

Useful commands
4. cd "C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.11.7\sbin"
5. rabbitmq-service start/stop
6. rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management  (Use http://localhost:15672/ to access management UI)
7. rabbitmq-server

Important points :
Make sure the RabbitMQ service is running on the central point.
RabbitMQ Server & Erlang need to be installed only on the server/central point(laptop). Only libraries needed for the Java files should be installed for the nodes (raspberry PI). 

Notes for remote commmunication :
Specify host (laptop/central point) IP address in application.properties for Sender
Make sure Reciever (laptop/central point) has incoming connections in firewall unblocked.
Make sure remote users (raspberry PIs) use the node user (or any with right permission) and not guest.
